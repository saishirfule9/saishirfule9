# 💫 About Me

Hi, I’m Sainath, a Backend Java Developer with hands on experience in building backend applications using Java, Spring Boot, and SQL, with basic exposure to React. I focus on writing clean backend logic, designing REST APIs, and working with databases to solve real world problems.

I have completed multiple internships and projects where I worked on backend modules, API integration, database handling, and basic frontend collaboration. I enjoy learning how real applications are structured and deployed. Currently, I am seeking an entry level Backend or Java Developer role where I can grow my skills while contributing to real development work.
